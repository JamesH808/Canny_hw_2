I believe my efforts to remove all malloc, calloc, and free calls were successful. I was able to compile and run the code without any errors or memory leaks. My approach to replacing any variable that used pointer and memory allocation was 
to make it an array of size ROWS * COLS, which I defined at the top of the code.
